# Staff-Talk Tickets (Moderators Only)

**For the first 2 months** as a Moderator, draft your messages in **#mod-chat** and get approval from Head Mods/HR before opening tickets.

## Important Guidelines

- **Punishment Tickets**:

  - Must be opened by **Staff**.
  - Do **not** give out punishments in tickets started by a member.
  - **Never** start the ticket by stating the punishment.

- **Opening a Ticket**:

  1. Go to **#open-a-ticket** and select **"Talk to a Staff"** button.
  2. Rename the ticket using `/rename` to: `Stafftalk-Username`.
  3. Add the user to the ticket with `/add`.

- **Communicating with the Member**:

  - Ping the user and request their time.
  - Share evidence of the rule they broke.
  - Explain the rule and how they violated it.

- **Professionalism**:

  - Do not argue with the member.
  - If needed, tag out for another Moderator in **#mod-chat**.
  - Remain calm and objective.

- **Issuing Punishments**:

  - Inform them of the punishment according to the **Staff Guidelines**.
  - Remove the member from the ticket after issuing the warning or timeout using `/remove`.

## Logging the Ticket

- The **Head Moderator** or **Head Moderator Assistant** will guide you on how to log the ticket into the **GitHub Warning Book**.
