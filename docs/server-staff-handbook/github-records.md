# GitHub Records (Moderators Only)

All moderation actions need to be recorded in the **GitHub Warning Book**.

## Procedure

1. **Access the GitHub Warning Book**:

   - Find it in the **mod-special** channel.

2. **After Closing a Ticket**:

   - The Mod on Call records the ticket into the GitHub repository.

3. **Creating a New Record**:

   - If the member hasn't broken a rule before, create a new record with:

     - **Discord Tag** and **Discord ID** in the title.
     - Upload a screenshot of their Discord profile.

     _Example_: `lolmaxz [229734830932361216]`

4. **Recording Details**:

   - When the rule was broken.
   - What rule was broken.
   - Punishment they received.

5. **Documentation**:

   - Add a screenshot of the ticket.
   - Mark it with the date of the incident.

6. **Applying Labels**:

   - Use labels to indicate the number of active warnings.
   - Warnings are active for **1 week**; subsequent infractions within this period escalate the warning level.

7. **Updating Records**:

   - Move the member to the appropriate warning or ban level based on the **Server Guidelines**.
