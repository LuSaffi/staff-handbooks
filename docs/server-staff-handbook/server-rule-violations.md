# Server Rule Violations

When a member breaks a server rule:

1. **Reporting**:

   - **Chat Moderators** report issues in **#server-chat-reports**.
   - **Cutie Helpers/Moderators** report in **#helper-chat**.

2. **Documentation**:

   - Provide a **screenshot** of the violation.
   - Specify the **rule** that was broken.
   - Delete the violating post in the channel.

3. **Member Reports**:

   - If a member reports an issue in a ticket, a **Moderator** handles it.
   - Gather details: **Who**, **Where**, and **When**.
   - Do not just thank them; ask for necessary information.

4. **Moderation Process**:

   - Confirm the violation in **#staff-talk**.
   - Discuss appropriate punishment in **#mod-chat** following the Server Guidelines.
