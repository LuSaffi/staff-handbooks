Not everything in chat requires escalating to a ticket. As a Cutie Helper, your responsibilities include:

- **Directing Members**:

  - Guide users to the appropriate channels.
  - Encourage reading channel descriptions or pinned messages.

- **Enforcing Use of Templates**:

  - Remind members to use provided templates where applicable.

- **Handling Minor Infractions**:

  - Politely address minor issues directly in the chat.
  - No need for formal warnings unless rules are being broken.

- **Screenshotting and Deleting**:

  - Capture evidence of any rule violations.
  - Delete messages that violate server rules (e.g., inappropriate images).

:::note
Always remain professional and courteous when interacting with members.
