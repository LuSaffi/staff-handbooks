# Going On/Off Call for Staff

To manage your availability for ticket notifications:

1. Use the command `/on-call` in any staff channel or the test channel of the server.

   - **On Call**: You will receive pings when tickets open.
   - **Off Call**: You will need to manually find and open tickets to see the channels.

:::info
This command allows you to be added to tickets within the server, ensuring you are notified when needed.
