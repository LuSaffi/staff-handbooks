# Verification Checklist

1. **Selfie with One ID**:

   - Ensure the issuing government/state/country, **DOB** (date of birth), and **expiration date** (if present) are clearly visible and unedited.
   - Users can wear sunglasses in the selfie and censor the eyes on the ID.

2. **Reject Unacceptable IDs**:

   - Reject **temporary paper IDs** or IDs without online examples.
   - **Expired IDs** are acceptable if not expired for more than **one year** and the photo matches the selfie.

3. **Handwritten Note**:

   - Must include the **current date** and **Discord username** (and tag if applicable).
   - Should be on a **paper-based material** (e.g., paper, post-it note, napkin).
   - **Screenshots** or digital screen images are **not accepted**.

4. **Username Match**:

   - The handwritten Discord username must match the user's account exactly (including tags if present).

5. **Authenticity Checks**:

   - If questionable, request the user to angle the ID or include the writing utensil in the image.

6. **ID Visibility**:

   - The entire ID, including all **four corners**, should be visible.
   - If the ID's background is unclear or doesn't match online examples, ask for a retake.

7. **Image Integrity**:

   - Check for shadows or inconsistencies around the ID edges to ensure it hasn't been cropped or edited.

8. **Background Check**:

   - Be cautious of plain white backgrounds or graph paper, as they can sometimes indicate underage users.

9. **File Name**:

   - Review the image's file name to ensure it follows common cell phone formats.
