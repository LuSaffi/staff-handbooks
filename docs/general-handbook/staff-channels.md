# Staff Channels

Once your application to be part of the staff has been accepted, you will be given the necessary role(s), granting you access to multiple new channels. This section highlights all the general staff channels you will have access to and their purposes.

Now, here's all the Channels you need to Familiarize yourself with

## Basic Text Channels

- **#🔔staff-announcements**: Channel where any announcement regarding staff will occur. It may be used for both the server and the event team.

- **#💾staff-documents**: Channel where any staff-related documents will be posted. Includes links to this handbook and other information like how to prepare a post to host an event.

- **#💜eden-applications**: Channel where applications to the server are posted. ⚠️ You'll be able to see applications once you are done with your training on event side and when you get moderator on Server side.

- **#🎉staff-projects**: Channel used for starting full staff votes for new ideas and for discussing upcoming changes. It can <b>_also_</b> be used by higher staff to delegate tasks to willing staff members.

  <summary>Important Note about 🎉Staff-Project</summary>
    <p>Staff-Projects is a channel where staff members can propose new ideas, changes, or improvements to the server.<br/>
    If you have an idea, you can post it here for discussion and feedback from other staff members. If the idea is well-received, it may be put to a vote to be implemented. <br/>
    There isn't good or bad ideas and absolutely all staff members are encouraged to share their thoughts or propose new ideas.</p>
    :::important
    ⚠️ Just remember to keep the discussion respectful and constructive.

- **#📃meeting-logs**: Channel where meeting notes and recaps are posted after meetings. If you miss a meeting, it's important to read the latest notes here. Only Committee members can write in this channel.

- **#📆event-scheduling**: Channel where a weekly post is made to show the schedule for the week.

- **#⭕server-chat-reports**: This channel is used to report anything you may see in chat that may or could violate our server's rules.
  - Cutie helpers and moderators may report things directly in **#📗helper-chat** or **#📙moderator-only** instead of using this channel
<details>
  <summary>Important Note about ⭕Server-Chat-Reports</summary>
    <p>Simply provide the message link to the problematic post and explain why you think it needed to be reported. The server team will handle the rest. <br/>
    If you are unsure if something should be reported, it is always better to report it and let the server team decide if it needs to be addressed. <br/>
    ANY staff member can report a message, but only server staff can handle the reports. This is just a faster direct line of communication for staff to report messages.</p>
