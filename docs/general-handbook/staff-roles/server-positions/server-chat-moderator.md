# Server Chat Moderator

Server Chat Moderators monitor chat activities anonymously.

### Responsibilities:

- Watch the server for any rule breakers and report incidents.
- They do not have special roles displayed, so members are unaware of their status.
- No application is required; the position is offered based on the server's needs.

:::note
Being anonymous helps Chat Moderators observe genuine interactions without members altering behavior.
