# Roles and Responsibilities

The Social Media Team is comprised of two sub-departments:

- **Social Media Team**
- **Graphics Team**

These two teams are grouped under the same department because their work is closely related and often overlaps.

## Social Media Team

- Drafting social media posts and polls.
- Recommending media content for social media posts.
- Suggesting photo and video ideas.
- Performing basic image touch-ups and edits for social media posts.

## Graphics Team

- Creating and editing media content.
- Producing and editing video content.
- Designing graphical assets from scratch.

:::note
Graphics Team members can take on Social Media Team tasks if they choose, but it's not mandatory. Social Media Team members are not expected to handle graphical tasks, which should be managed by the Graphics Team.
