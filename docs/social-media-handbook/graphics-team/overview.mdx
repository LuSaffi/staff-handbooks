# Graphics Team Overview

The **Graphics Team** is primarily responsible for creating media materials for various Eden needs, including announcements, advertisements, posters, and banners.

- All work-in-progress (WIP) and completed graphical materials must be saved in the **GDrive** under the designated root folder: `\Eden Graph`.
- The team is encouraged to work independently on projects.
- Urgent requests with specific deadlines will be posted in the **"Deadlines/Duty"** thread within the **#social-media-team** channel.
