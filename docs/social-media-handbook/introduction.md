# The Social Media Team Handbook

_Document Version: 1.0_

Welcome to the Social Media Team! Thank you for your interest in joining us to help shape the online presence of **The Eden Apis**. Our team is dedicated to fostering a safe, engaging, and fun environment for all our members, both within the community and across our social media platforms. This document will outline key information you need to know as a staff member on the Social Media Team, helping you to contribute effectively and make our community as enjoyable and inclusive as possible.

:::note
As a member of **The Eden Apis Social Media Team**, you are expected to maintain professionalism and courtesy when interacting with other staff members and the community. Our team is held to a higher standard when it comes to online behavior and managing potentially uncomfortable social situations. However, this doesn’t mean you need to adopt a customer service persona at all times. We value authenticity and don’t want anyone to feel forced to put on a false front. We understand that not everyone will be best friends, but we do expect that you treat all members of the community with respect. It's important to keep drama out of our social media channels and to focus on creating a positive, welcoming environment.
:::

The purpose of this document is to provide you with an overview of the team and its operations. This handbook contains detailed descriptions of all current team procedures and guidelines.

_Note: This document may be updated over time. When something new is added or edited, a staff announcement in the Discord server will be made to inform you of those changes!_
