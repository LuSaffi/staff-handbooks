   - Contact the user via DM to request their consent.

2. **Key Questions**:

   - Determine if they are granting **one-time consent** or **recurring consent**.
   - Ask if they require **credit** for their content.
   - Confirm their **VRChat username**.

3. **Documentation**:

   - Save all consent evidence to the **GDrive** under:

     ```
