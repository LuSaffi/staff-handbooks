# Posting Procedure

Both the **Social Media** and **Graphics Teams** are allowed to prepare posts, though it is primarily the responsibility of the Social Media Team.

## Steps

1. **Submission**:

   - Posts must be submitted to the **“Social Posts Planning”** forum channel for review.

2. **Review Process**:

   - All posts must undergo a team review through a simple voting process.
   - For any necessary decisions regarding a post, discuss them within the post itself.

3. **Communication**:

   - Keep the **“Social Posts Planning”** channel free of unrelated chatter.
   - Use appropriate threads or channels for discussions not related to post planning.

## Deadlines

- The Social Media Team has until **Friday at 11:59 PM EST** to submit their post suggestions.
- **Voting** on posts will take place only on **Saturdays and Sundays**, closing on **Sunday at 11:59 PM EST**.
- Posts will be scheduled for publication on **Sundays** each week, with exceptions made for special announcements.
