# Media Content

Any **Eden Apis**-related media content can be used for social media posts, including:

- Finished graphical assets created by the **Graphics Team**.
- **Event photos**.
- Pictures posted by users in the **SFW** and **NSFW VRC** channels.
- Simple, catchy Eden-related text, announcements, or news.

## Guidelines

- All photos planned for a post must include either a community member (with their explicit consent) or any content related to **VRChat** and/or **Eden Apis**.
- Any **VRChat** or **Eden Apis**-related graphical material is acceptable for use in social media posts.

## File Management

- All planned and prepared images/videos must be saved to the **GDrive**.
- Since our goal is to post materials the following week, save content under:

```
\Eden Social\Week XX - XX-XX Month 2024
```

- This points to the following (next) week, starting from Saturday.
- The folder name should indicate the week of the year and its date range.

- **Image Censoring**:

- Censoring is no longer required.
- **Instagram** and **TikTok** prohibit NSFW content, including images or videos featuring excessive skin exposure, nipples, or genitalia.
- Such content is not accepted on these platforms, even if censored.

Always ensure that the content aligns with platform guidelines and community standards.
