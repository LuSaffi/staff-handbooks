# The Eden Apis Handbook Collection

Welcome to the official handbook collection for The Eden Apis Discord community. This project is built using Docusaurus to provide a comprehensive and easy-to-navigate resource for our members.

## Project Overview

It covers a wide range of topics, including server hierarchy, departmental duties, and community guidelines.
